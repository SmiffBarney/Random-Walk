Random Walk Simulation

This project seeks to simulate a simple random walk. The user will define a number of walkers, and a total number of steps. At each step, each walker will travel in a random direction at a distance of either 1 or -1. The backend calculations of the simulation are handled in C++, whereas the user-interface and graphing is handled using python. Because each step is perfectly random and unbiased, the resultant simulation shows that this is an example of normal diffusion, where the squared displacement grows linearly with time. 

Visualization

Individual Paths: On the left-hand side, the complete trajectories of the first 5 walkers are displayed.

Ensemble-Averaged Squared Displacement: On the right-hand side, a plot shows the average squared distance of all walkers from the origin as a function of time (​t).
